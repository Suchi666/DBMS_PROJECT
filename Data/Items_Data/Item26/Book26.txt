                 Chicken Little

This story is very old and well known. I used it during literacy t get the children to read along with me. This is the story of a little chicken that thought the sky was falling down after an acorn fell on his head. He convinced many other animals including a duck and a fox that the sky was falling down.
The reason I used this story was because it had a simple pattern that the children could easily follow. This helped the less confident students become more comfortable in reading to me. Children found it easy to get into and once they understood the pattern they seemed to read this story more easily than others. The illustrations are extremely pleasing to the eye and help in keeping the story interesting. A nice quick read for all foundation stage children!

When I was really little, this was probably my favorite book. My mom always tells me that I would get her to read it to me (over and over and over...), but if she missed even a word, I would make her start again, because I knew the whole book by heart and wanted it read to me exactly as it was written! lol... That is so me!

I think the author cheated the fox out of a good meal. It was unrealistic.
